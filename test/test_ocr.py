Code Analysis

Objective:
The main objective of the 'main' function is to prompt the user to select an image file using the file explorer, extract text from the selected image using pytesseract library, and print the extracted text on the console.

Inputs:
The 'main' function does not take any input parameters. However, it prompts the user to select an image file using the file explorer.

Flow:
1. The function logs the message 'Running the script locally' using the logging module.
2. It creates an instance of the Tk class and hides the main window using the withdraw() method.
3. It prompts the user to select an image file using the askopenfilename() method from the filedialog module.
4. If the user selects an image file, it extracts text from the image using the image_to_string() method from the pytesseract library.
5. If the image file is not selected or an error occurs during text extraction, it sets the text variable to an empty string.
6. It prints the extracted text on the console.

Outputs:
The main outputs of the 'main' function are:
- The extracted text from the selected image file printed on the console.
- The message 'No file selected' printed on the console if the user does not select any image file.

Additional aspects:
- The function uses the logging module to log messages.
- It uses the PIL library to open the selected image file.
- It uses the pytesseract library to extract text from the image.
- The function uses the Tkinter library to create a file explorer window.
